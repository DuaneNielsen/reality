# Submodule Disaster Recovery Status Report

**Date**: 2025-09-13  
**Branch**: `feature/explore_camera`  
**Status**: üö® CRITICAL - Entire branch is broken  
**Context Reset**: Required due to complexity  

## Executive Summary

The `feature/explore_camera` branch is completely unusable due to systematic submodule coordination failures. Every commit on this branch fails to build, making it impossible to rollback to any working state. This represents a fundamental breakdown of revision control principles.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Broken Submodule Coordination
- Main repo commits expect `setMultiWorldGrid()` method that doesn't exist in referenced submodule commits
- Submodule commits are internally inconsistent (code uses struct fields that don't exist)
- No atomic commit workflow was followed for cross-repository changes

### Specific Failure Modes

1. **Missing Method Error**: 
   ```cpp
   // Main repo calls this but submodule doesn't have it
   viewer.setMultiWorldGrid(true, config.world_spacing, config.grid_cols, 
                           worldScaleX, worldScaleY);
   ```

2. **Struct Field Inconsistency**:
   ```cpp
   // Submodule code uses worldWidth/worldHeight
   .worldWidth = 40.0f,
   .worldHeight = 40.0f,
   
   // But struct only has worldScaleX/worldScaleY
   struct ViewerControl {
       float worldScaleX;
       float worldScaleY;
   };
   ```

### Tested Commits - All Broken
- ‚ùå `27091eb`: Missing multi-world fields in struct
- ‚ùå `8e882f7`: Field name issues  
- ‚ùå `df939cd`: Incomplete refactor (worldWidth vs worldScaleX)
- ‚ùå `5bcf2dc`: Physics API mismatch
- ‚ùå `f98da04`: Physics API mismatch
- ‚ùå `79dc5c2`: Missing setMultiWorldGrid method
- ‚ùå `3ea4fa9`: Missing setMultiWorldGrid method

## Current State

### Repository Status
- **Current HEAD**: `ccdfde3` on `feature/explore_camera`
- **Submodule**: Points to `df939cd` (broken)
- **Build Status**: Fails with struct field errors
- **Working Directory**: Has uncommitted submodule changes

### Error Examples
```cpp
// Build error from df939cd submodule commit:
error: field designator 'worldWidth' does not refer to any field in type 'ViewerControl'
error: no member named 'worldWidth' in 'madrona::viz::ViewerControl'
```

## Recovery Strategy

### Phase 1: Context Preservation ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Document all broken commits and failure modes
- [x] Preserve research findings for next session
- [x] Create comprehensive status report

### Phase 2: Find Working Baseline (Next Session)
- [ ] Systematically test remaining untested commits
- [ ] If no working commit found, revert to main branch
- [ ] Document any working commit as recovery baseline

### Phase 3: Implement Proper Workflow (Next Session)
- [ ] Create atomic commit procedure for submodule changes:
  1. Make submodule changes and commit them
  2. Update main repo submodule reference
  3. Commit main repo changes that use new submodule features
  4. Test build at each step
- [ ] Never commit main repo changes until submodule is working

## Critical Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. **No Atomic Commits**: Changes spanning submodule + main repo were not committed atomically
2. **No Build Testing**: Commits were made without verifying they build
3. **Inconsistent Field Names**: Refactoring was incomplete across files
4. **No Rollback Strategy**: Created situation with no working rollback points

### Prevention Measures
1. **Always commit submodule changes first**
2. **Test build after every commit**
3. **Use proper cross-repo development workflow**
4. **Maintain at least one working commit per feature**

## Next Session Action Items

1. **Find Working Baseline**: Test remaining commits systematically
2. **Clean Slate Approach**: If no working commit found, start fresh from main
3. **Implement Proper Workflow**: Follow atomic commit procedure
4. **Create Working Feature**: Rebuild multi-world grid functionality correctly

## Files Requiring Attention (Next Session)

### Submodule Files (external/madrona)
- `src/viz/viewer.cpp` - setMultiWorldGrid implementation
- `src/viz/viewer.hpp` - Method declarations  
- `src/viz/viewer_common.hpp` - ViewerControl struct fields
- `src/render/shaders/shader_common.h` - DrawPushConst struct
- `src/render/shaders/viewer_draw.hlsl` - Shader parameter usage

### Main Repo Files
- `src/viewer.cpp` - setMultiWorldGrid method calls (lines 639, 643)
- `src/viewer_core.cpp` - Multi-world config
- `src/viewer_core.hpp` - Config struct definitions

**Recovery Priority**: HIGH - Cannot proceed with any development until working baseline is established.
