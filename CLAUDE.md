# Development Guidelines

## Philosophy

### Core Beliefs

- **Incremental progress over big bangs** - Small changes that compile and pass tests
- **Learning from existing code** - Study and plan before implementing
- **Pragmatic over dogmatic** - Adapt to project reality
- **Clear intent over clever code** - Be boring and obvious
- Engineering safety:  Never fail to mention failing tests, even if they are incidental to the current object, failing tests are always a problem and should never be overlooked.
- **Git management discipline**: NEVER make git management mistakes that risk losing progress.

### Simplicity Means

- Single responsibility per function/class
- Avoid premature abstractions
- No clever tricks - choose the boring solution
- If you need to explain it, it's too complex

## Overview

This is a Madrona Escape Room - a high-performance 3D multi-agent reinforcement learning environment built on the Madrona Engine. It implements a navigation environment where agents explore and try to maximize their forward progress through the world.

**Tech Stack:**

- C++ (core simulation using Entity Component System pattern)
- Python (PyTorch-based PPO training)

# Headless Mode Quick Reference

Headless mode runs simulation without graphics for benchmarking, testing, or server deployment.

## to see the options run

```bash
./build/headless --help
```

# Essential Commands

### Building the project

Use the project-builder subagent to build the project, or use the build.sh script directly:

**Quick build (recommended):**
```bash
./build.sh                    # Quiet build - shows only "Build successful" or errors
./build.sh build              # Same as above (explicit)
./build.sh --verbose          # Show detailed build output for debugging
```

**Full build with reconfiguration:**
```bash
./build.sh fullbuild          # Full build with reconfiguration + code generation (quiet)
./build.sh fullbuild --verbose # Full build with detailed output
```

**Other build options:**
```bash
./build.sh clean              # Clean all build artifacts
./build.sh rebuild            # Clean then full build
./build.sh build --test       # Build and run tests
./build.sh --jobs 8           # Use 8 parallel jobs instead of default 16
```

**Note on CUDA Kernel Cache:** All build commands automatically clear the CUDA kernel cache (`build/madrona_kernels.cache`) to ensure correct optimization levels. The cache provides ~20x speedup within training sweeps but is cleared between builds to prevent debug/optimized contamination.

**Legacy manual build command (if build.sh unavailable):**
```bash
make -C build -j16 -s         # Fast, parallel, quiet incremental build
```

### Running the Simulation

to visualize the simulation for the user, run the viewer, it will create a playable simulation that the user can use to interact eith the simulation
read the viewer guide in [VIEWER_GUIDE.md](docs/tools/VIEWER_GUIDE.md) for commands on how to run the viewer

### Running python code

ALWAYS use uv when running python code or managing packages

```
uv run python ...
```

```
uv run python default_level.py 
```

### Development

#### Python coding standards

IMPORTANT: when writing tests for python code ALWAYS use the pytest framework by writing the test in the tests/python directory, and following pytest conventions

GOOD:

test/python/test_my_code.py

BAD:

test_my_code.py <---- DO NOT DO THIS

IMPORTANT: NEVER use sys.path.insert(..) ALWAYS place modules in the correct locations so they can be imported correctly by python

**CRITICAL: NEVER reassign constants or create redundant assignments**

NEVER do this idiotic pattern:
```python
# BAD - Creates fragile, stupid code
from some_module import SomeConstant
class MyClass:
    SomeConstant = SomeConstant  # NEVER DO THIS GARBAGE
```

ALWAYS use proper imports:
```python
# GOOD - Clean, maintainable imports
from some_module import SomeConstant
# Just use SomeConstant directly in your code
```

This prevents NameError disasters during refactoring and keeps code clean.

#### C++ coding standards

# Testing

### Running Tests

**Quick Test Command:**
```bash
uv run python tests/test_tracker.py --dry-run
```
This runs both C++ and Python tests in the standard test suite. Use this for quick verification after changes.

**Manual Test Commands:**
This project uses pytest for python tests and GoogleTest for C++ tests
All testing procedures are documented in [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) - the single source of truth for testing
C++ unit tests are also documented in [CPP_TESTING_GUIDE.md](tests/cpp/README.md)

IMPORTANT:  Whenever tests fail, ALWAYS report it using the standardized format below.  We may decide to take no action, but we should ALWAYS ALWAYS mention the failure in the correct format first.

### Test Output Format

**CRITICAL FOR CONTEXT PRESERVATION**: This exact format enables test identification and debugging after context resets. Without precise test paths (`test_file.py::test_name`) and reproduction commands, failing tests cannot be located or fixed in future sessions.

When reporting test results, use this exact format immediately:

**"Do NOT make up test names - only use the real test names from the actual pytest output."**

"When reporting test results, you MUST use this EXACT format with actual test file names and test function names from the real test output:"

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ C++ Tests: X/X passed

### ❌ Python Tests: X passed, X failed, X skipped

**Failed Tests:**

- ❌ `test_file.py::test_name` - Brief error description
- ❌ `test_file.py::test_name` - Brief error description

**Reproduction:**

```bash
uv run --group dev pytest tests/python/test_file.py::test_name -v
```

### Example Test Output:

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ C++ Tests: 18/18 passed

### ❌ Python Tests: 145 passed, 2 failed, 15 skipped

**Failed Tests:**

- ❌ `test_bindings.py::test_deterministic_actions` - Position comparison failure
- ❌ `test_spawn_locations.py::test_single_spawn_center` - Wrong spawn X: -20.0 (expected -6.25)

**Reproduction:**

```bash
uv run --group dev pytest tests/python/test_bindings.py::test_deterministic_actions -v
uv run --group dev pytest tests/python/test_spawn_locations.py::test_single_spawn_center -v
```

### Why This Format Is Mandatory

1. **Context Reset Recovery**: After context resets, only exact test paths allow continuation of debugging work
2. **Direct Reproduction**: The bash commands can be copied and run without modification
3. **150+ Test Navigation**: With 150+ Python tests and 18 C++ tests, vague descriptions like "tensor tests failed" are useless

**Without this format**: Information needed to fix tests is permanently lost when context resets occur.



### Unit test best practice

**IMPORTANT**: when writing unit tests use the cpu_manger fixtures in conftest.py, DO NOT call the SimManager directly, unless you are specfically testing the SimManager initialization itself
**IMPORTANT**: when creating plans to implement new features, the plan must ALWAYS include tests in the appropriate unit test framework

### Rules when fixing CPP tests

**IMPORTANT**:  After you make C++ code changes, **you must rebuild the project** using `./build.sh` or the project-builder subagent!

### Debugging using GDB

If the user asks to "debug the code", or "debug it" or generally references "debugging" then interpret this as a request to use the GDB tool to gather information about the behaviour of the program, and follow the following procedure

1. read the file [GDB_GUIDE.md](docs/development/GDB_GUIDE.md)
2. use the debug tool in your MCP library to gather information on the problem at hand, or study the code

## Git Management Rules - CRITICAL

**NEVER make git management mistakes that risk losing progress.**

I will:
- **ALWAYS** check git status thoroughly before any commits
- **ALWAYS** ensure all related work is committed together
- **ALWAYS** verify what's staged vs unstaged vs untracked
- **NEVER** leave implementation work uncommitted

Bad code can be fixed. Bugs can be debugged. But losing progress due to careless git management is unacceptable and wastes valuable time.

# Documentation

## Documentation creation rules

- when proposing new documents, always add them to the docs folder
- when the user asks save a plan to a file it should be written to docs\plan_dump

# Scratch files

When creating a python file that we don't want to keep in the repo, but just want to use for the purposes of a one-time test or to study/understand code better.  Create it in the ./scratch folder. 

# Code Classification System

The codebase uses a three-tier classification system to help developers understand what needs to be modified:

### [BOILERPLATE]

Pure Madrona framework code that should never be changed. This includes:

- CPU/GPU execution infrastructure
- Memory management systems
- Rendering pipeline setup
- Base class structures

### [REQUIRED_INTERFACE]

Methods and structures that every Madrona environment must implement:

- `loadPhysicsObjects()` - Load collision meshes and configure physics
- `loadRenderObjects()` - Load visual assets and materials
- `triggerReset()` - Reset episode state (for episodic environments)
- `setAction()` - Accept actions from the policy
- Tensor export methods - Define observation/action spaces
- Reset and action buffers - Required for episodic RL

### [GAME_SPECIFIC]

Implementation details unique to this escape room game:

- Action structure fields (moveAmount, moveAngle, rotate, grab)
- Observation tensor types and shapes
- Object types and their physics properties
- Material colors and textures
- Game constants (see Game-Specific Constants section below)

When creating a new environment:

1. Keep all `[BOILERPLATE]` code unchanged
2. Implement all `[REQUIRED_INTERFACE]` methods with your game's logic
3. Replace all `[GAME_SPECIFIC]` code with your game's details
